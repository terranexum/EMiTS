# EMiTS - A Framework and Metric for Producing Accelerated Sustainability Action Plans (ASAPs) 

* [ASAPs - freely distributable plans are now available for 87 cities and 16 counties in Colorado.](https://github.com/terranexum/EMiTS/tree/main/ASAPs)
* docs - Documentation on EMiTS, including its definition as a metric based on physically conserved values
* src - code used to generate the ASAPs, plus under-development code to generate a UNIGRID for each.
* UNIGRIDs - upcoming geospatial visualizations able to vary over time to guide the understanding and implementation of our ASAPs.

## Get progress rolling. ASAP. Because...

## Overview

We wanted to find a way to work with complex networks so that any flows involve energy, matter, or information over time and space could be represented in terms of a maximizable metric. Through such maximization, we hope to achieve greater efficiencies in these flows, thus accelerating our energy and carbon transition.

EMiTS is a framework incorporating Energy, Mass, Information, Time, and Space, based on a composite metric of these five quantities. These quantities are arranged in such a way that the value of EMiTS increases only when more mass can be moved over longer distances for less energy in less time. Progress toward sustainability goals increases as the total EMiTS value across the global economic network continues to increase.
