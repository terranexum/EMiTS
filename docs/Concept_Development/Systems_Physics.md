# Background on Systems Physics

At present, the fields of [systems biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology) and [systems engineering](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/se/) exist. Systems physics does not seem to have been defined, though it underlies both these fields. Just as biology requires an understanding of chemistry, which requires an understanding of physics since all higher activities must occur according to physical laws, our present understanding of systems biology and systems engineering may be greatly improved by an understanding of systems physics. In every field of study, there are important quantities that must be measured. In systems physics, we have a quantity defined by EMiTS, a composite metric of five variables: energy, mass, information, time, and space. 

EMiTS can be used as the measure of any economic product or service such that free market transactions can take place in accordance with physical laws. Each transaction is done in a way that results in greater sustainability. This work rests on the thought that perhaps the climate problem is not a technology problem or a human problem, but a problem resulting from the non-optimization of our economic activities around metrics inconsistent with the laws of physics.

## Theory Behind EMiTS

Given that there are nodes (people who want to buy or sell) and transactions between two nodes are describable as edges, what we have is a standard flow network. 

It’s important to define the quantity that is flowing. Oftentimes in complex networks we have to define a composite quantity, some metric by which we can optimize the flow throughout the network by. In this case, if we have energy that needs to be transacted, our token or unit of value needs to reflect that somehow. If we have mass that needs to be moved from a seller to a customer, we also need to take that into consideration when valuing that product.

This led me to think of a composite metric to describe this flow which requires optimization. The metric can aptly be described by the acronym EMiTS: energy, mass, information, time, and space, as follows: ${{MS} \over {ET}}$.

Just as the whole economy is currently structured so that each person seeks to maximize their net work, the goal here is also to maximize the value of EMiTS across the entire network, which can be done at the level of every individual, neighborhood, city, state, or nation, regardless of what spatial scale is being examined. 

The finer the scale, the greater the node density in any given area, and the greater the amount of information that needs to be handled over the network to support economic activity. Every act of exchanging information can be represented by a node on a temporal network, with edges intersecting that node which represent the entities exchanging the information. The value of that information can be defined as the sum of each entity's ${{MS} \over {ET}}$ required for their participation in the information exchange. 

The quantities are where they are in the ratio ${{MS} \over {ET}}$ because in any economic transaction involving a product, we always seek to move the greatest amount of mass we can over the longest distance possible for the least amount of energy over the shortest amount of time. Since space in this most basic sense is just the distance a mass needs to be moved across, ${S \over T}$ is effectively a velocity V and the product of that times mass M produces a momentum. Energy is in the denominator so EMiTS is really a ratio of two conserved values, momentum and energy. Since momentum and energy are always conserved, creating a token or unit of value based on these quantities ensures the stability of the value of such a token, because it is backed by nothing short of physical law itself.

If people make transactions such that they are always seeking to maximize their quantity of tokens, just as they would seek to do with any currency to maximize their net worth, free market dynamics will occur in such a way as to optimize the continued growth of available tokens and the overall value (i.e. a nation’s GDP) of the flows across the whole network. This can be done by installing more renewable energy, which increases the denominator and thus effectively lowers the asking price for the entity generating electricity (e-gen). People who need that energy will then want to buy it because of its low cost. 

## Observations

Many economic systems and social structures have evolved over time, but humanity has yet to recognize the need for such constructions to be in alignment with physical laws. Any metric we use to coordinate our economic activities must be based on the laws of physics. 

To use currencies that might get backed by some form of precious metal, which is only precious because those in power who made existing laws for their societies said so, does not guarantee that economic activities will take place that are sustainable. Network dynamics take place that affect the well-being of all participants, including those in power because such non-optimized networks will always be unsustainable.

In comparison, defining economic value from the ground up in accordance with physical laws allows for our economic activities to be in line with the energy and resource flows taking place within every other ecosystem on earth. Everything on land and in the ocean that makes use of sunlight that we use as the basis for the food and resources that power our modern economies, all of these naturally obey the laws of physics. Landscape ecology, biogeography, and population dynamics teaches how the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of every interaction between individuals within populations within these ecosystems are all the result of these systems’ self-optimization toward one goal. This goal is to improve the current that flows within each system, described by constructal law. And every such flow can be described by EMiTS.

## Applications in the Engineering of Complex Networked Systems

The global economy is perhaps the largest complex networked system we have created. Its activities are responsible for many global problems such as climate change. It is from thoughts such as this that EMiTS came to be developed: 

* A student earns $300 a week after traveling back and forth to a job where she provides services to someone worth $3 million. 
* At the gas station, the student buys 10 gallons of gas for $30.
* In the course of her travels, she emits a ton of CO2 emissions, which costs $300 to remove. This is the same as what she makes in a week.
* She and many others want to lead more sustainable lives. Who should bear the costs of removing those CO2 emissions? Are the near-term costs worthwhile considering the longer-term benefits of achieving sustainability?

EMiTS was developed to address whether we can make business-as-usual purchasing decisions that automatically lead to climate progress without requiring incentives, education, or changes to policies. All from changing the value of whatever is being transacted, which requires a minimally brief agreement between just two people. 

[Beginning from first principles](https://github.com/terranexum/EMiTS/tree/main/Concept_Development), it becomes clear how any product or service being transacted requires flows of energy and matter across networks that are distributed across space and time. All flow networks seek to maximize the flows they contain. EMiTS can be used to quantify those flows. We cannot efficiently change what we cannot measure, and with EMiTS, it appears to be possible for us to implement necessary changes with great efficiency. reorient our economic activities around the natural tendency for all flow systems to self-optimize, just by introducing a more useful metric for assigning value to everyday products and services.

# Next Steps

Change the metric we optimize our economy by, at the most central locations where we all derive our price information, and we can change everything for the better.

Climate change and all other social ills do not seem to be problems resulting from the lack of sufficient technologies or from human nature. Human nature is what it is only as the result of many generations of social optimization around many metrics other than physical law, resulting in much conflict, scarcity, and even death over the course of millennia. It has taken the advent of art, language, writing, and now science to understand the nature of physical laws. 

Given what you have now read, there is a choice to be made - will you choose to maintain business as usual, or might you choose to try experiments within your neighborhoods and communities toward the adoption of this new metric to see what happens? Your starting point: start from commodity pricing and redefine every other price and wage based from that. See where this goes and add to what you've read here.
