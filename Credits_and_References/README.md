## Acknowledgments

I would like to provide the following acknowledgments to those who have provided me with critical experiences and data points leading to the development of EMiTS. First, those I can no longer send questions to or to thank further for their guidance:

* [Dr. Robert Behringer](https://today.duke.edu/2018/07/physics-professor-robert-p-behringer-dies-69), for my first experiences in nonlinear complex systems and granular materials physics
* [Dr. Steve Vogel](https://today.duke.edu/2015/11/stevenvogel), for showing me how physics can be merged with biology into biomechanics, demonstrating that the form and function of all living systems obeys physical laws
* [Dr. Michael Atiyah](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/obituaries/michael-atiyah-dead.html), for our few correspondences on octonions and related topics, demonstrating that the richness of how we understand our world is forever imperceptible without some understanding of symbolic mathematics, just as we will never know the works of authors in our libraries if we cannot read, write, or understand the language of those books.

Below are those still with us, whose work and guidance have been worthy of acknowledgment:

* [Dr. Adrian Bejan](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/adrian-bejan), professor of mechanical engineering at Duke University, for our few correspondences on his work as the originator of [constructal law](https://mems.duke.edu/research/energy/bejan-constructal-law) - that every system evolves to improve whatever flows through it
* [Dr. Steve Simske](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/se/steve-simske/), Professor of Systems Engineering, Colorado State University, for his brilliance, kindness, and dedication to helping others in the pursuit of knowledge.
* [Dr. Thomas Bogdan](https://sunearthday.nasa.gov/podcasts/transcripts/SWLH-BIO_Thomas_Bogdan.pdf), Chief Science Officer at TerraNexum, authored over 100 scientific papers, served as the sixth president of NCAR/UCAR in Boulder, CO, and inspired me to carry forward the work of climate action from the standpoint of science. 
* [Dr. Loren Winters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loren-winters-23225176/), Educator, Physicist, Photographer, and Partner at TerraNexum, for being a constant in my life which is otherwise full of variables.
* [Michael Heller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdheller/), data scientist at IBM, for many discussions around the Riemann Hypothesis which led to my realization that a proof likely would have been found by now if the pursuit of knowledge was considered more valuable than the pursuit of material wealth.
* Chris Neidl and Matt Parker, co-founders of the [OpenAir Collective](https://openaircollective.cc), for helping me explore my interests around carbon dioxide removal in a way that was free and open, not locked behind patents or paywalls. It was heartening and encouraging to see a whole volunteer community develop around open hardware carbon removal, as well as policy development to promote larger projects for the sake of our climate. 
* Lecia Ductan and Alicia Gibb of the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://oshwa.org) (OSHWA), for providing me with the opportunity to apply my work in systems engineering and open hardware carbon removal to demonstrate how such principles can expand the use of open source hardware in academia.
* Barton Rhodes, CEO of [Plurigrid](https://plurigrid.xyz), for many brilliant information exchanges at speeds and volumes unmatched anywhere else. Given his wealth of knowledge and accomplishments thus far, I'm happy to be of help wherever I can.
* [Andy Quezada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oaquezada/), Chief Technology Officer at TerraNexum, for both his brilliance and honesty at all things pertaining to technology and people. I learned some critical perspectives that I had been missing for a long time. It is because of something he said that I laid out the groundwork for EMiTS later that night.
* You, for reading this and taking this forward in your own way.
