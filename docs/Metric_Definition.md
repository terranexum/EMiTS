# The EMiTS Metric

We use metric units consistent with typical human-scale activities requiring energy, matter, and information flows. When these are converted to to SI units, we are left with units of inverse velocity, s/m. We may be able to achieve a dimensionless EMiTS value by multiplying the current formula by a constant with units of speed, m/s. The speed of light `c` comes to mind, which is the maximum speed of any energy, mass, or information flow. It is unknown whether the speed of light needs to be used in this context, but its presence allows for values that have typical orders of magnitude compared to present day currencies. It also produces a dimensionless value for the EMiTS metric.

If a value is not representable for an item or service, its value is set to 1 below. An example of this in a transaction: a heat pump weighing M = 100 kg must be transported a distance of S = 10 km to service a home that requires E = 10 kWh of heat over T = 24 hours. Mass M and distance S only appear in the initial state. Thus, to compute the following ratios, we must use a 1 in the place of non-defined variables.

These expressions are not meant to define a final product. The intent is to develop these further into a metric that is more useful for achieving sustainability goals than current metrics by which we value items and services.

## For any product:
$$ value = { c {MS} \over {ET} } $$

where

M = the mass of the product being offered by the seller, in kg

S = the distance the product must be moved from the seller to the buyer, in km

E = the energy required to transport that product from the seller to the buyer, while removing greenhouse gases resulting from its transportation, in kWh

T = the time it takes for the product to be moved from the seller to the buyer, in hours

## For any service:
$$ value = { c {MS} \over {ET} } $$

where

M = the mass of the person providing the service, in kg

S = the distance the person must travel to provide that service, in km

E = the energy required for the person to perform that service, which includes energy from food and energy for transportation, in kWh

T = the time it takes for the person to provide the service, in hours

## For composite products:
$$ value = \sum_{p=1}^n { c {MS} \over {ET} } $$

where 

p = a product within the composite product

## For a service requiring multiple people:
$$ value = \sum_{p=1}^n { c {MS} \over {ET} } $$

where 

p = a person participating in the performance of the service

## For information:

Information is not included in the general form of the EMiTS metric, though if it were to be included, it would reside in the denominator. That is because to optimize the exchange of information, the least data needs to be exchanged over the shortest amount of time possible needed to achieve the desired outcome. This is easily understood: brevity is more efficient than verbosity, and one-page summaries are more efficient than thousand-page reports if the same outcome can be achieved. Information is what is exchanged during any act of communication, whether spoken, written, typed, drawn, gestured, or otherwise communicated. The exchange of information already requires the expression of all four EMiTS variables to account for the expenditure of energy, the reconfiguration of mass or energy to represent that information, requires storage over space, and requires some amount of time to take place. Thus when valuing information, the same expression can be used for the EMiTS metric as when it is used for valuing any physical product or service.
