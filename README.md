# EMiTS - A Framework and Metric for Producing Accelerated Sustainability Action Plans (ASAPs) 

* ASAPs - as these are published, they will be available here.
* docs - Documentation on EMiTS, including its definition as a metric based on physically conserved values
* src - the EMiTS code, which can be run from this folder using `python app.py`. At present, this will run a test server at http://127.0.0.1:5000 to display a network built from test data in the `static` folder. There is also a `notebooks` folder containing a Jupyter notebook that can be run on Google Colab. Both are still under development.
* UniGRIDs - geospatial visualizations able to vary over time to guide the understanding and implementation of ASAPs.

## Overview

EMiTS is a framework incorporating Energy, Mass, Information, Time, and Space, based on a composite metric of these five quantities. These quantities are arranged in such a way that the value of EMiTS increases only when more mass can be moved over longer distances for less energy in less time. Progress toward sustainability goals increases as the total EMiTS value across the global economic network continues to increase.

## Primary Use: Accelerating Sustainability Efforts

EMiTS can be used to improve the speed and scale of grassroots, community-level clean energy expansion efforts.

Cities are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions on average, but suburban areas offer more space for renewable energy installations such as rooftop solar. Instead of waiting for new transmission lines and long permitting and construction processes to occur, portable energy storage transported into cities and back during daily commutes presents an alternative that can make a difference in helping cities make rapid progress toward their sustainability goals. 

## Broader Uses

EMiTS is envisioned as a way to help restructure any complex network so that any transaction involving energy, matter, or information can be represented in terms of a maximizable metric. Through such maximization, greater efficiencies can be achieved in the flow of energy, matter, and information across time and space.

Unsustainable activities and processes appear to result when  economic decisions are based on valuing goods and services in ways that do not completely account for physical quantities that must be conserved. These are energy and momentum, the latter of which is mass times distance divided by time. 

## An Example

Say that a company like Amazon needs to deliver a 10 kg package to a customer who is 200 km away. They should charge that customer 10 x 200 = 2000 units (M x S), divided by whatever the energy was that was required to ship the package. This energy quantity is minimally what was purchased from the energy provider. For time, if the customer wants their item in 1 day instead of 3 days, the time variable in the denominator would be 1 instead of a 3. Which results in a 3x increase in the cost that the customer will be asked to pay. Optimization will then occur in the direction of maximizing future value. Such optimization takes place as we build new technologies that can yield faster deliveries of heavier items using lower amounts of energy.
