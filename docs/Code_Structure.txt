Node class in node.py: This class represents a node in the graph network. It would contain the following properties:

id: A unique identifier for the node.
flow: The flow of the single metric combining energy, mass, information, time, and space through the node.
neighbors: A list of neighboring nodes.
calculate_gradient method: This method calculates the gradient of the flow of the single metric for the node.
update_flow method: This method updates the flow of the single metric for the node based on the gradient and a step size alpha.
Graph class in graph.py: This class represents the graph network. It would contain the following properties:

nodes: A list of nodes in the graph network.
edges: A list of edges in the graph network.
calculate_gradient method: This method calls the calculate_gradient method for each node in the graph network.
update_flow method: This method calls the update_flow method for each node in the graph network.
MaxFlow class in max_flow.py: This class implements the consensus-based distributed max-flow algorithm. It would contain the following properties:

graph: An instance of the Graph class.
alpha: The step size for the update of the flow of the single metric.
maximize_flow method: This method implements the consensus-based distributed max-flow algorithm. It initializes the flow values at each node, calculates the gradient and updates the flow of the single metric until a steady state is reached. The final values of the nodes and edges can then be outputted for visualization.
visualize.html and visualize.js in the visualization folder: These files use the JavaScript library 3d-force-graph to visualize the final values of the nodes and edges as a graph network. The final values of the nodes and edges outputted by the MaxFlow class can be inputted into these files to display the graph network.

Test files in the test folder: These files contain unit tests for each class in the codebase to ensure that they are functioning correctly.

README.md: A file containing documentation for the codebase, including instructions for how to run the code and visualize the results.
