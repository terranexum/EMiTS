'''
Node class in node.py: This class represents a node in the graph network. It would contain the following properties:

id: A unique identifier for the node.
flow: The flow of the single metric combining energy, mass, information, time, and space through the node.
neighbors: A list of neighboring nodes.
calculate_gradient method: This method calculates the gradient of the flow of the single metric for the node.
update_flow method: This method updates the flow of the single metric for the node based on the gradient and a step size alpha.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id, flow, neighbors):
        self.id = int(node_id)
        self.flow = float(flow)
        self.neighbors = neighbors

    def calculate_gradient(self):
        gradient = 0
        for neighbor in self.neighbors:
            gradient += float(neighbor.flow) - float(self.flow)
        return gradient

    def update_flow(self, gradient, step_size):
        self.flow += float(gradient) * float(step_size)

'''
In this implementation, the calculate_gradient method calculates the gradient of the flow with respect to its neighbors by summing the difference in flow between the node and its neighbors. The update_flow method then updates the node's flow by adding the product of the gradient and a step size to the node's current flow.
