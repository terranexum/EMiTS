# UniGRID: A Unified GIS (Geographic Information System) for Renewables Integration and Deployment

A set of network-based visualizations for each ASAP area, produced using the code being developed here to identify how energy and resource flows can be optimized to achieve faster, more profitable emissions reductions.

This section will be developed after the ASAPs and EMiTS sections are complete.
