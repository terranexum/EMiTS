# Credits and References

## Acknowledgments

I would like to provide the following acknowledgments to those who have provided me with critical experiences and data points leading to the development of EMiTS:

* Dr. Adrian Bejan, for our few correspondences on his work developing constructal law - that every system evolves to improve whatever flows through it
* Dr. Robert Behringer, for my first experiences in nonlinear complex systems and granular materials physics
* Dr. Steve Vogel, for showing me how physics can be merged with biology into biomechanics, demonstrating that the form and function of all living systems obeys physical laws
* Dr. Michael Atiyah, for our few correspondences on octonions and related topics, demonstrating that the richness of how we understand our world is forever imperceptible without some understanding of symbolic mathematics, just as we will never know the works of authors in our libraries if we cannot read, write, or understand the language of those books.
* Dr. Steve Simske, Professor of Systems Engineering, Colorado State University, for his brilliance, kindness, and dedication to helping others in the pursuit of knowledge.
* Dr. Thomas Bogdan, Chief Science Officer at TerraNexum, author of over 100 scientific papers in atmospheric physics, the sixth president of NCAR/UCAR in Boulder, CO, and my source of inspiration for carrying the torch of climate action formward. 
* Dr. Loren Winters, Educator, Physics Instructor, Photographer, and Partner at TerraNexum, for being a constant in my life which is otherwise full of variables.
* Chris Neidl and Matt Parker, co-founders of the OpenAir Collective
* Lecia and Alicia Gibb, the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)
* Andy Quezada, Chief Technology Officer, TerraNexum
