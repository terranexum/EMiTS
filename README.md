# EMiTS - A Framework and Metric for Producing Accelerated Sustainability Action Plans (ASAPs) 

* [ASAPs - freely distributable plans are now available for 87 cities and 16 counties in Colorado.](https://github.com/terranexum/EMiTS/tree/main/ASAPs)
* docs - Documentation on EMiTS, including its definition as a metric based on physically conserved values
* src - code used to generate the ASAPs, plus under-development code to generate a UNIGRID for each.
* UNIGRIDs - upcoming geospatial visualizations able to vary over time to guide the understanding and implementation of our ASAPs.

## Get progress rolling. ASAP. Because...

## How to Contribute

To contribute to this repository and help accelerate sustainability action plans (ASAPs) to be created around the world, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Make changes and improvements to the codebase as needed. If you're not sure where to start, check out the "Issues" tab to see if there are any open tasks that need attention.
4. Test your changes to make sure they are working as expected.
5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request (PR) to the original repository to merge your changes back in. Be sure to include a detailed description of the changes you made and why they are important.

Remember that ASAPs can be made for any location in the world using this free and open source code. If you would like to help us source data for other areas or make and disseminate your own customized ASAPs, please let us know by contacting us at info@terranexum.com. We welcome your contributions and look forward to working with you to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

## Overview

We wanted to find a way to work with complex networks so that any flows involve energy, matter, or information over time and space could be represented in terms of a maximizable metric. Through such maximization, we hope to achieve greater efficiencies in these flows, thus accelerating our energy and carbon transition.

EMiTS is a framework incorporating Energy, Mass, Information, Time, and Space, based on a composite metric of these five quantities. These quantities are arranged in such a way that the value of EMiTS increases only when more mass can be moved over longer distances for less energy in less time. Progress toward sustainability goals increases as the total EMiTS value across the global economic network continues to increase.
