# Steps in the Development of EMiTS

Perhaps a first step is to gain some initial familiarity with different fields of knowledge where quantities are defined and measured. 

By doing so, it is possible to see how there always appear to be variations on the same themes in every field, each described by different words in different places by different people. For example, an eco-industrial park, eco-industrial cluster, and technology cluster are all variations on the same concept of co-locating people and technological capabilities to improve the efficiency of one or more activities.

It then becomes possible to understand that each of these variations have inputs and outputs, and were created for some purpose. Basically, each of these is a function. With input parameters that are processed to create some output. Energy is always an input to all of these. Examining the other possible inputs and factoring those inputs to their most basic inputs yields the quantities within EMiTS - energy, mass, information, time, and space. 

Once these recurring themes are understood in terms of functions, and more such functions are found in other fields, the next step in the investigation becomes whether there is some way to assemble each of these functions by connecting their inputs and outputs. If each function is a node, then edges can be drawn where one function's output becomes another function's input. 

Eventually, a network of functions forms, not unlike a neural network where individual neurons connect together to integrate many inputs to produce many outputs.

At that point, it becomes possible to comprehend the following:

1) that the world is a massively complex dynamical system of networked systems, performing untold numbers of computations every second through flows of energy, matter, and information,
2) that living things are themselves networks joined by interfaces and interactions to the physical network, and
3) that the things that living things build are also themselves networks, joined by interfaces and interactions to other living things that interact with these. 

Networks can exist within networks, as long as each network can be represented by spatially distributed nodes over which some flow can be summed. Not much different from a quad tree representation that partitions a map into smaller and smaller self-similar squares - as long as a value can be determined for each square, the value of the entire quad tree can be determined. In the same way, local networks (microgrids for example, or technology clusters) can have some value that is the result of all nodes contained therein, and these values can be summed at higher levels of network structure, finally providing a value for the entire network itself. Over time, the network naturally optimizes itself to maximize this value.

There may also be networks not just across space, but over time. Below is an attempt to convey the vague details that I understand of this at the moment, if time flows from left to right and interacting flows (entities, energy, mass, information) follow the lines that also travel from left to right. Interactions, transactions, and events appear as nodes where these flows intersect. Haven't explored this much farther yet. There is blur both forward and backward in time because our awareness really only encompasses the present. We only have recollections of the past that grow worse the far back we go. And our ability to influence future outcomes diminishes the farther forward we try to forecast.

The best clarity we can have of this spatiotemporal network appears to be within a small area of focus, not too different from how we have an entire eye just to support one point at which light is focused, allowing us to have a visual awareness of the world.

No light is involved in making this mental image, and thus there isn't anything like a lens I can use to focus this to make it more clear. But it seems like I have more chances everyday to attempt to resolve this even better. Definitely just a kind of sketch since I can't draw.
