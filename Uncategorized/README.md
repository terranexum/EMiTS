### 1/22/2023 - A different perspective on things

I went on a hike today and had a picture taken of me with trees and snow all around. From a different lens, I also saw networks, flows, and transactions. Each tree is just a spatially distributed network supporting flows of energy and matter. No leaves now, but extend these spatial networks through time a few months and there will be transactions of air and water across each leaf and root, themselves supporting more flows through their even smaller networks.

Itâ€™s the same three things at every scale, everywhere. Networks, flows, and transactions. When I left to go home, I did so on the road network supporting a flow of cars to come home to a flow of information coming through to my computer, being processed by millions of electrical transactions per second in all the transistors before reaching the screen where light energy could then flow to my eyes and hit the network that is my brain.

I know many people get bored often, most of all when I used to talk and write a lot about highly technical things. I now see that was not a good use of time spent conveying information; it is more optimal and efficient to spend less time and less words to reach the same desired result. Thus, as a summary of my experiences with boredom, both of others and previously of my own, I see there is really plenty enough stimulation and entertainment to be found in the world. Your environment must first be conducive to motivating your eyes to really see. Then you can notice small things, like how much more shape complexity there is in a forest of trees than the world of right angles we see indoors and throughout our cities every day. 

People evolved to process complex spatial information that most of us are now miles away from. And temporal information, which is much more than just numbers on our cell phones or even hands tracing circles on clock faces. Maybe you can imagine something more kike a bus route map, but with a time axis going from left to right for events which are like the bus stops. People also used to understand numbers logarithmically as I learned not too long ago. There is some interesting history there in how most all societies moved away except or a few, right around the time we started learning to count in integers to keep track of things we needed to trade. It was advantageous to be able to count items, to create names and categories, all concepts that were abstractions of more fundamental details. We found near-term benefits from doing so - we found we could organize ourselves according to such trades, and eventually we sought to optimize our organization and activities to maximize our benefits from such trades. 

Today's economy is the result. I think that perhaps all our problems and inefficiencies continue to grow because of the continued divergence of our activities away from the optimal conditions the laws of physics require of those activities as well as of our spatial distributions.

Due to these pressures today and the problems we face from our changing climate, which is only occurring because of our non-alignment with physical laws, perhaps a more long-term view of things would be helpful. Especially when our long-term survival may depend on it.

### 1/23/2023 - A dynamic equilibrium between centralization and decentralization

Whether a system is centralized or decentralized at present might be expressed by the dynamic equilibrium of attractive and repulsive forces acting on the nodes of that system. Under conditions of scarcity that encourages greed, centralized systems tend to win out because each node/person is less likely to share and cooperate. Those that learn to share and cooperate are likely the products of more favorable conditions, and thus decentralized systems tend to win out during such times because it is of less personal cost (and perhaps even a great benefit) to share resources and to work together for even greater gains.

### 1/23/2023 - Systems physics applied to cybersecurity: dynamic security shells

It appears that today's cybersecurity could use an improvement from using more static defense perimeters to having dynamic defense perimeters. At present, we build security enclaves around core protected resources. It's like spherical shells or onion layers to protect what's inside. There are only ever a finite number of shells, and each shell takes some finite time to penetrate if nothing else changes. 

Perhaps it is possible to use some form of dynamically updating encryption, like outwardly propagating shells from the core to the outermost perimeter over time. No more static onions waiting for attackers to tunnel through since the whole onion updates synchronously, maybe many times a second, and maybe with a variable update frequency as well. The innermost shell passes its state to the next outer shell - if you have 10 shells in your onion of protection, after 10 updates what attackers will see at the outermost perimeter is whatever the key was that the core generated 10 cycles earlier.

Public key encryption just keeps requiring longer and longer keys to protect data. The disparity continues to increase between someone still using 123456 as their password and enterprises able to afford CISSPs to provide RSA_4096 keys to employees to access their AES_256 encrypted data. It's like having a few Fort Knoxes embedded in a sea of unlocked homes...creating any kind of secure infrastructure on top of such nodes really doesn't offer the greatest overall security across the entire network. Instead of investing more and more time making longer keys that take longer to decrypt, and now needing to roll out post-quantum encryption, maybe we can all just use shorter keys that can dynamically update in the manner described.
